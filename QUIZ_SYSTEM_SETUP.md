# Simplified Quiz System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a streamlined quiz system that uses the existing users table for storing quiz data, eliminating the need for separate tables.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Run the Simplified Quiz Schema
Execute the SQL commands in `quiz_database_schema.sql` in your PostgreSQL database:

```sql
-- Connect to your database
\c project_sgd

-- Run the simplified quiz schema
-- This adds quiz-related columns to the users table and creates quiz tables
```
