- 🤖 **AI Cultural Assistant** – Uses the **Ollama model** with an experimental **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system:
  - Fetches cultural information from the database.
  - Generates related explanatory text for user queries.  
- 🧠 **Quizzes for Interactive Learning** – Users can test their knowledge about India’s culture, making the experience educational and engaging.
